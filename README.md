[A list of UI component libraries for Expo and React Native apps.](https://docs.expo.dev/ui-programming/user-interface-libraries/)

we can use :

1. paper (older , so there are almost all the features are added so far.Best for learning)
2. TamaGui (works both on web and the app perfectly)
3. RNUILib is also good (but the doc is not complete, there are some errors on the doc demo)
